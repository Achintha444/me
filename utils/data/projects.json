Most of the time, we find that the garbage cans at ATM locations are overflowing with meaningless receipts that consumers have requested. That is what inspired me to work on this design project. As a result, I created a completely new user interface that would limit the amount of unnecessary receipts issued. An experiment was carried out to validate the design. This investigation concluded that by employing this design, we can cut receipt printing by roughly 50%. This is a huge benefit because we are simply changing the interface to reduce this amount, which means there is no additional expense to execute this design, making this solution incredibly scalable, sustainable, and low risk."

To achieve this I replaced the 'Yes/No' interface with an interface which makes use of Fitts' and von Restroff's laws. After that, I ran a little test to validate the design. This experiment involved 153 participants. According to the findings of this experiment, we can cut receipt printing by roughly half.",

Researchers have proposed smartphone-based crowdsourced applications as a low-cost effective approach to obtaining frequent road surface quality updates over the last few years. The values show large fluctuations over the conditions under which the road data was collected, which is one of the key drawbacks of these applications. Through this project we created a road roughness monitoring platform based on passenger cars that can generate reliable findings while minimizing the impact of variables such as car type, smartphone model, or location. Among the features of the created system includes automatic travel detection, the ability to use any smartphone in any location with or without an active internet connection, combining information from various sources, and viewing them on a virtual map. This study also proposes a complete system to identify and classify road anomalies from crowd-sensed smartphone data adjusting to different vehicle speeds and other characteristics. A set of field tests were carried out to evaluate the proposed system and the results show that the proposed solution is effective in predicting accurate International Roughness Index (IRI) values and road anomalies after reducing the effect of these varying factors."

Following that, we used Android to construct the application. Then, up until the backend was created, we tested the mobile application and made adjustments based on the results. Since we lacked sufficient resources, we were only able to do a few basic user tests the application. Following that, we developed the web application and machine learning model to display the outcomes. While I constructed the most of the mobile application, my partner created the majority of the two portions mentioned above."

Although the practicability of mobile apps has become an essential part of the routines of many people, consumers are increasingly concerned about their data privacy. Most of the time, these privacy policies that are used to collect and share data are lengthy and complex to understand. Therefore, a common user finds it hard to understand before agreeing to the privacy policy terms. This project propose an approach to convey privacy policies in a way that a common user can comprehend."

Then, using the information gathered from the interviews and research papers, we developed the ten categories. Following that, we created a chat bot mobile application so that consumers could communicate with the bot about their privacy concerns. For example, if a user wants to know a company's data reservation policy, they may easily communicate with that bot and obtain such information."

Through a mobile application, we introduced a modern approach to mitigate health risks, eliminating the need for manual entry or QR code scanning. Leveraging Figma for design, Flutter for development, and Firebase for data management, we successfully created a user-friendly and contactless system that not only enhances safety measures but also showcases the potential of technology to address real-world challenges effectively. This project not only advanced my technical proficiency but also deepened my understanding of technology's role in promoting public health in unprecedented circumstances.",

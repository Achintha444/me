Most of the time, we find that the garbage cans at ATM locations are overflowing with meaningless receipts that consumers have requested. That is what inspired me to work on this design project. As a result, I created a completely new user interface that would limit the amount of unnecessary receipts issued. An experiment was carried out to validate the design. This experiment concluded that by using this design, we can reduce receipt wastage by roughly 50%. This is a huge benefit because we are simply changing the interface to reduce this amount, which means there is no additional expense to execute this design, making this solution incredibly scalable, sustainable, and low risk.",

To achieve this I replaced the 'Yes/No' interface with an interface which makes use of Fitts' and von Restroff's laws. After that, I ran an experiment to validate the design. This experiment involved 153 participants and according to the findings of this experiment, we can reduce receipt printing by roughly 50%.",

Researchers have proposed smartphone-based crowdsourced applications as a low-cost effective approach to obtaining frequent road surface quality updates over the last few years. The values show large fluctuations over the conditions under which the road data was collected, which is one of the key drawbacks of these applications. Through this project, we created a road roughness monitoring platform based on passenger cars that can generate reliable findings while minimizing the impact of variables such as car type, smartphone model, or location. Among the features of the created system include automatic travel detection, the ability to use any smartphone in any location with or without an active internet connection, combining information from various sources, and viewing them on a virtual map. This study also proposes a complete system to identify and classify road anomalies from crowd-sensed smartphone data adjusting to different vehicle speeds and other characteristics. A set of field tests were carried out to evaluate the proposed system and the results show that the proposed solution is effective in predicting accurate International Roughness Index (IRI) values and road anomalies after reducing the effect of these varying factors.",

We conducted testing on the mobile application and made adjustments based on the results. Due to resource constraints, we were only able to perform a few basic user tests of the application. Following that phase, we developed the web application to display the results.

To mitigate this, we reduced the rate of data collection through the mobile application.
